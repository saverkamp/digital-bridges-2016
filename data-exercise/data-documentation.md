###Walt Whitman papers, 1854-1892  
The Berg Collection's letters and manuscripts by Walt Whitman cover the years 1859 to 1891 with a small amount of material as yet undated. Strengths of the collection include nearly 30 poems or poem fragments and Whitman's autograph revision of the Analysis of Poems by Dr. R. Bucke. This essay was written for Bucke's authorized biography (Walt Whitman, 1883) and Whitman's extensive revisions were incorporated before publication. The correspondence includes two longer runs, one to William O' Connor and the other to his wife Ellen O'Connor. The O'Connors were active in a number of social causes, as well as devoted advocates of Whitman and his writing. William O'Connor, author of The Good Gray Poet (1866), was one of Whitman's closest friends until an argument in 1873 caused a break in their friendship. Others who figure prominently in the Berg Collection's Whitman materials include John Burroughs (1837-1921), nature writer, literary critic, and author of Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person (1867); Peter Doyle and Harry Stafford, young friends of Whitman's; and Richard Maurice Bucke (1837-1902), Whitman's authorized biographer, friend and literary executor. In addition to writing Walt Whitman (1883) and Walt Whitman, Man and Poet (1897), Bucke co-edited with Horace Traubel and Thomas Harned The Complete Writings (1902).

##About the Data
The datasets are drawn from metadata accompanying the above digitized collections on NYPL's [Digital Collections](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org) website. Original description was created by a number of processing archivists working with collections held in NYPL's Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection of English and American Literature.  The metadata was encoded into the [MODS](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/) XML schema for digital library materials by a project archivist hired to support the digitization of these collections. To make this data accessible in a tabular format, select data fields were taken from this MODS XML and the Digital Collection's index.  

Multi-valued fields are represented as semicolon-delimited lists within each column (ex. "rcp:Peabody, Elizabeth Palmer, 1804-1894; aut:Mann, Mary Tyler Peabody, 1806-1887"
