##Data Wrangling Glossary

**Controlled vocabularies** are organized and defined lists of words or phrases, usually within a specific domain or scope, that aid in information retrieval, search, and display. 
 
**Disambiguation** is the process of removing semantic ambiguity from a term or concept and distinguishing it from similar terms, usually through unique naming or the addition of qualifiers or additional information.
 
**Encodings** are standard formats for representing information in a machine-readable way. Encodings ensure that concepts such as dates or natural language characters can be communicated appropriately across applications.

**Filtering** allows you to narrow your focus on a large number of records by selecting only those that meet a specified criteria, such as a matching text value. 

**Facets** allow you to narrow your results even further through the application of multiple filters.

**Granularity**,  or specificity, is the level of depth at which information is represented in data. 

**Mappings**, or crosswalks, are used to describe both the process of translating data elements from one model to another and the resulting documentation.

**Normalization** is the process of shaping data into a standard format for consistency and machine-readability.
